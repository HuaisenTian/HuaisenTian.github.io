<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a graduate student majoring in Mechatronics Engineering at **Sichuan University (四川大学)**, focusing on the research and development of soft electronic devices. My work aims to enhance the stretchability and stability of soft electronics and explore their innovative applications.

My research includes the creation of multifunctional soft electronic circuits, mechanical structure design, circuit simulation, and the development of host computer applications utilizing flexible electronics. Additionally, it involves the design and implementation of neural networks for processing timing signals.
